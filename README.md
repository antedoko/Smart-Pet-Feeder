The aim of this final project is to develop a smart pet feeder with two modes of operation: automatic feeding and remote feeding via a web application. Automatic feeding involves dispensing a certain amount of food at a specified time. Remote feeding is possible by simply clicking the "Feed Now" button on the application's website, which is described in detail in the paper. In addition to the feeding capabilities, the owner can also monitor the pet and the state of the feeder through the web application.The introduction of the paper mentions smart devices for pets, with a focus on smart feeders. The second chapter provides a detailed description of the Raspberry Pi computer, which is the "heart" of the feeder. The basic characteristics of the computer, OS installation, and basic settings are described. The third chapter provides a step-by-step guide to setting up the Apache HTTP web server. The fourth chapter explains the process of creating a web application and the basic tools used in its implementation. The fifth and sixth chapters present in detail the characteristics, connection with the Raspberry Pi, and programming of the servo motor and camera module. The seventh chapter shows the code for automatic feeding. In the eighth chapter, the hardware part of the feeder is described and depicted. Finally, the shortcomings of the developed system are listed, and possible improvements are suggested.
